# Flags SDK â€” GrowthBook Provider

The [GrowthBook provider](https://flags-sdk.dev/docs/api-reference/adapters/growthbook) for the [Flags SDK](https://flags-sdk.dev/) contains support for GrowthBook's Feature Flags and Experiments.

## Setup

The GrowthBook provider is available in the `@flags-sdk/growthbook` module. You can install it with

```bash
pnpm i @flags-sdk/growthbook
```

## Provider Instance

You can import the default adapter instance `growthbookAdapter` from `@flags-sdk/growthbook`:

```ts
import { growthBookAdapter } from '@flags-sdk/growthbook';
```

## Example

```ts
import { flag } from 'flags/next';
import { growthBookAdapter } from '@flags-sdk/growthbook';

export const summerBannerFlag = feature<boolean>({
  key: 'summer-banner',
  adapter: growthBookAdapter.feature(),
});
```

## Experimentation (A/B Testing)

In order to run GrowthBook experiments, you must define a tracking callback function. This is called every time a user is put into an experiment and can be used to track the exposure event in your analytics system.

```ts
growthbookAdapter.setTrackingCallback((experiment, result) => {
  console.log('Viewed Experiment', {
    experimentId: experiment.key,
    variationId: result.key,
  });
});
```
